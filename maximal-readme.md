## Background

A new model reduction neural network architecture for fluid flow problem is presented. The SAE network compresses high-dimensional physical information into several much smaller sized representations in a latent space. These representations are expressed by a number of codes in the middle layer of SAE neural network. Then, those codes at different time levels are trained to construct a set of hyper-surfaces with multi variable response functions using attention-based deep learning methods. The inputs of the attention-based network are previous time levels’ codes and the outputs of the network are current time levels’ codes. The codes at current time level are then projected back to the original full space by the decoder layers in the SAE network.
